# SimpleGallery
This project is a simple Image Gallery Application built using React Native and Expo as part of the Mobile App Development Lab.

The app displays a grid of image thumbnails, and when a user taps on any image, it shows a larger version of that image along with its caption. The project demonstrates essential React Native concepts such as state management, conditional rendering, FlatList usage, component styling, and event handling.
